Named Entities Recognition

## SUBTASKS
* Mediacal Named Entity Recognition
* Chinese Named Entity Recognition
* Nested Named Entity Recognition


## INTRODUCTION
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the process of labeling named-entities in the text. Named entities are real-world objects such as persons, locations, organizations etc, that can be denoted by a proper name.

## SURVEY
Research starts with [Stanford NER](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html)
